      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>Everything on our menu is worth waiting in line for!</p>
      <p>Caruso Coffee opened its first stores in the United States in 1976, before the American public knew the term “specialty coffee.” In the years that have followed, Caruso Coffee continues to build its brand and franchise organization on the principles of time-tested and honored traditions and values. Exceptional coffee, a warm relaxing environment, and a corporate culture that embraces its franchisees with every opportunity to succeed and exemplify these values.</p>
      <p>Our story in coffee found its origin in the reality that coffee has the potential to be so much more than just coffee. It can be a simple means to a greater and not so simple end for the common good of all people in its reach. Caruso Coffee is committed to buying, roasting and retailing specialty coffees. Caruso Coffee ensures the highest quality through monitoring and nurturing the coffee seed at every stage of its life. Our job is complete when that coffee hits your cup. Whether you are simply enjoying your morning brew or you're fine-tuning and obsessing over your coffee's nuances, you can trust that Caruso Coffee is roasting and presenting the best we can offer.</p>
      <p>You can sense the difference the moment you arrive at our shop where all of our hand-selected beans are roasted, flavored and packaged. The abundant aroma of fresh roasted coffee surrounds you in a professional environment where every Caruso Coffee team member is committed to the same core values that our founders established in the early 1970s.</p>
