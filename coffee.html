				<h2>Premium Quality</h2>
				<p>Our intimate knowledge of each harvest, and our highly tuned palates, guide us in unleashing the latent potential of each harvest. We roast in small batches to order, creating a dynamic palette of flavors from subtle and nuanced, to bold and brassy, and ship our coffee within days to best showcase the artistry of farmer and roast master alike. All of your favorite Caruso Coffee coffees are prepared only from freshly roasted coffee beans. Beans are roasted by hand in small batches by skillful roaster, at our own roastery, located in a beautiful countryside place near Varene River. Freshly roasted coffee beans breathe and mature for a couple of days and then is sent out to our Caruso Coffee location and then - straight to your cup! Our coffee masters have distilled their years of tasting knowledge down to three simple questions to help you find a Caruso Coffee coffee you’re sure to love. We search for and discover beans so special and rare that we can’t wait to bring them home and share. Each of our hand-packaged coffees has its own story to tell, and we meticulously develop a signature roast for every one of them.</p>

				<h2>Fair Trade Certified</h2>
				<p>In order to find coffees that satisfy our stringent quality protocol and secure the future of the farmers and farms our coffees come from, we’ve developed a sourcing model that is one of a kind. We put farmers at the center of what we do. We recognize their expertise as well as their right to fair compensation and a democratic voice. At the heart of our model is a desire for relationships and closeness. Throughout the year, we travel to spend time with farmers, and our time on the farm is deliberate and critical. As we and the farmers we work with learn more about each other, we become better partners and as our relationships become more transparent, the more trust we share.  Our time at origin also helps us become more familiar with the unique varietals, processing methods, and micro-climates that distinguish every cup. Coffee is one of the simplest things in the world. It can simply be received and enjoyed or it can be examined and studied and the depths of its compounds would be scarcely exhausted. We want to honor the hard work of the farmers and everyone involved in the coffee process to display the coffee in the fullness of its goodness. Coffee is often regarded as a kind of fuel for life, so much so that over 83% of the world drinks coffee. But it does not stop there, coffee is not just something that people drink, in fact, there are over 125 million people who depend on the production of coffee for their livelihood! We want to make a difference in the lives of those who produce coffee, striving to connect our local cups to a global cause!</p>
